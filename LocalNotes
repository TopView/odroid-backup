This is a clone of Adrian Popa's odroid-backup.pl

I have formatted it in my own personal coding style, so don't expect it to be standard style.  

But that said, it's pretty much the same code as from https://github.com/mad-ady/odroid-backup with a few minor changes.

It's the first perl program I've worked with in a couple of decades, and I had to re-learn perl to read this code and to find
out why it wasn't working for me.  In the end, the original author fixed my bug before I noticed that it was fixed.  :-)  So this
turned out to be just a learning process for me.

Looks like Adrian Popa doesn't sport any licence on this code, so I'm assuming it's just for personal use.

Sure do appreciate Adrian Popa's work in writing this code!  Thank you.
